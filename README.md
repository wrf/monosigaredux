# monosigaredux
attempt at generating corrected gene models for the choanoflagellate Monosiga

This includes using correct gene boundaries (as defined by the ESTs which were otherwise never used) and finding genes which are not predicted at all (but ESTs indicate presence of a gene in this locus).

Scripts are available here, but better models are predicted by AUGUSTUS using the EST training.

GFF of the gene models can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/wrf/genome-reannotations/downloads
